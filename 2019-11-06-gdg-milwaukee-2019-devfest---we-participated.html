<p>
I attended the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/GDG-UWM/events/264945191/">GDG Milwaukee 2019 DevFest</a> last Saturday. This was my
second hackathon. Around 6-9 teams participated. We coded for six
hours, and I learned a lot about team dynamics. We formed a team of eight
participants. We encountered a couple significant challenges.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7c49b1e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7c49b1e">The stack matters</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c49b1e">
<p>
Initially we decided to use Python and the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django framework</a>. This
turned out to be a grave error, because picking up Django quickly
while staying productive is challenging. This challenge is
multiplied by unfamiliarity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">MVP</a> web frameworks.
</p>

<p>
A couple hours in we sat down and decided Django had to go. We
realized two of us had prior experience with <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a>. Combined with
<a href="https://www.flaskapi.org/">flaskapi</a> this could be a wonderfully simple way to build a RESTful
API backend.
</p>

<p>
For the frontend we used <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a>. I did not work with it
much, but I found it easy to run, deploy, and tweak. I think it was
a solid choice.
</p>

<p>
The hardest part of our stack was integrating our hand-rolled RESTful
API into the React.js based frontend. In fact we weren't able to
complete this, but we got really close. It was a lot of work to get
as far as we did as a team.
</p>

<p>
Most of the other groups also used Python. Multiple groups used
Django, and one group even used <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django Rest Framework</a>. They
appeared to be facing the same challenge we were having with getting
Django to do anything productive in the allotted time. I know at my
next hackathon I won't be recommending Django to the uninitiated.
</p>

<p>
The winning team used <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>. Every project I've seen done in
Firebase was rapidly prototyped, indicating it is extremely suitable
for hackathons. I have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">deep reservations</a> about using a proprietary
PaaS, but maybe I can put this concern aside for my next
hackathon. :)
</p>

<p>
Java. At my university and most others in my area, Java is the first
language we learn. In some cases it may be the only language one
really learns well. In this light, a team member mentioned perhaps we
could use <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> or some other Java web framework in future. This
seems like a superb idea, I hope to explore this in an upcoming
project with classmates.

<h2 id="org3201ba3">Debian surprised me (again)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3201ba3">
<p>
A funny experience during the hackathon was discovering a rather
surprising patch Debian's virtualenv package ships. On CentOS 7,
Gentoo, and possibly anything not Debian derived, running <code>python3 -m
  virtualenv ./venv</code> will create a Python3 virtual environment. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51534831/python3-virtualenv-installs-python2">This is
not the case on Debian</a>. Instead Debian <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/python-team/modules/python-virtualenv/blob/master/debian/patches/python2-default.patch">will always default to
installing <code>python2</code></a> in the virtual environment. One must pass <code>-p
  python3</code> to install python3. Sure seems wonky to me!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org196ff90" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org196ff90">Demos never work</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org196ff90">
<p>
We almost had a working demo, but the part that got us was
deployment. I spun up a <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultr</a> VPS, installed npm, node, caddy,
virtualenv. I got the API backend running, and built the Create
React App pages, and tied it all together with a Caddyfile, but it
simply wouldn't work. There was too many moving parts, and manual
deployment was too tedious to get right within the time frame.
</p>

<p>
There is something to be said for working in
containerized workflows; this would have been a non-issue. Drop in a
<code>docker-compose.yml</code> into the project and just run <code>docker-compose
  up</code>. Next time :)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf194fec" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf194fec">Teamwork is essential</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf194fec">
<p>
We had a team of eight members, and it was challenging to find
tasks for everybody. Given we had two major components &#x2014; frontend
and backend &#x2014; and we had quite a few members who needed
instruction to get started, it was challenging to give both the
coding and instructing enough attention. In future I strive to have
more balanced teams so everybody can feel more involved. Perhaps a
good rule of thumb is to pair at most one beginner to one
intermediate, never more than one.
</p>

<p>
Something else I think that will help is ensure nobody gets
pigeonholed into managing the project; rather, share the
responsibility. Project managers are likely not effective in a
half-day Hackathon.
</p>

<p>
Keep morale up. Don't let negativity distract from the team
tasks. Redirect negativity into going for a walk, playing video
games, or simply taking a break. Make sure to smile.

<h2 id="org20a58e6">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org20a58e6">
<p>
I had fun at GDG Milwaukee DevFest. Good food, good company. We
found our initial choice of Django was not productive in true
hackathon spirit. Flask was better for this. Maybe next time we'll
consider Firebase. If I had a nickle for every Debian patch that
violated my own idea of least surprise, I'd have laundry
money. Demos are hard, deployments should be automated or otherwise
streamlined. Finally, teamwork is vital. Keep the team small, and
make sure everybody has things to do.
</p>

<p>
See you next year GDG.
