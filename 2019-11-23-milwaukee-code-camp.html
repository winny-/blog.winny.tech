<p>
This most recent weekend (November 16th) I attended the <a href="https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/">Milwaukee Code
Camp</a> and was pleased with the content. There was plenty of food,
coffee, and give-aways.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orga8ba07b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga8ba07b">The Talks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga8ba07b">
<p>
I attended five talks:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>starting an open source project (<a href="https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/session/details/1217">link</a>) <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>,</li>
<li>how to manage work life balance as a software developer (<a href="https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/session/details/1210">link</a>),</li>
<li>getting started with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a><sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> (<a href="https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/session/details/1212">link</a>),</li>
<li>introduction to <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> for cloud infrastructure management (<a href="https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/Session/Details/1205">link</a>),</li>
<li>and accessibility (a11y) on the modern web (<a href="https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/session/details/1234">link</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>
I am pleased to say the open source fellow recommended GPLv3, MIT/X,
and Apache 2.0 (and <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choosealicense.com</a>), so I have a lot of respect
for him. I think a lesser open source evangelist would recommend one
license, or strongly recommend one license. It really does depend on
your project.
</p>

<p>
I was able to get <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">Minikube</a> set up during the Docker/k8s talk in five
minutes. No surprises when installing it from the official Gentoo
repository. Just follow the installed readme, run the commands… it's
really quite easy to do. A friend commented it wasn't so simple on
their system to install Minikube and get it working.
</p>

<p>
While I don't think I would use Terraform at this point, I have a
good appreciation for when I might use it in the future. In
addition, I found a <a href="https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt">Terraform provider for libvirt</a>, so one could in
theory provision their own cloud infrastructure on a simple libvirt
cluster with Terraform. I believe this might be my first use-case
for Terraform.
</p>

<p>
It was refreshing to see people talking about accessibility and the
web. I am personally not a fan of the web stack for various
reasons.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> But the reality is the technology won't go away, and the
browser is the greatest common denominator both reaching users and
simplifying the a project's platform support matrix. It was great to
hear from somebody in industry "your website should be <b>somewhat</b>
usable without javascript". I am really pleased to hear this; perhaps
there is hope for the web ecosystem yet.

<h2 id="org79f345b">The Food</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org79f345b">
<p>
Sweet pastries, water, soda, coffee were available in the
morning ad throughout the day. There may have been more
comprehensive breakfast items (cereal?), though I was late for the
first session. Lunch was Dominos pizza and brownies. There was no
shortage of pizza. The coffee was catered from Panera Bread.

<h2 id="orgffcdc5f">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgffcdc5f">
<p>
In addition to learning about Terraform, Kubernetes, and
accessibility, I met a lot of cool people. I think this event was an
overwhelming success. Thanks to everybody who organized this event.

This is a discussion in itself. For example: I think a large
majority of the user and developer experience with web technologies
does not adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least surprise</a>, making it very
frustrating for everyone involved.
