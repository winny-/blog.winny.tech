Archlinux is a Linux distrobution that emphasizes simplicity, modern
packages, and flexibilty of configuration. It is a good learning tool
to understand some of the basics of most Linux systems such as the
steps of installation, how things are typically configured without the
aide of GUI helpers, and the woes of inadequate package management. I
still recommend it as a system to research the basics of modern Linux
environments, but that is it. In every other situation, Archlinux is
probably going to cause more problems than it will solve for a given
use-case.
