As a heavy user of SSH to manage computers and IRC via command line
clients, the most used application on my phone besides the web browser
is a SSH client. Previously I have used Prompt and it worked, but
barely. My issues with Prompt include crashing on emoji spam that is common
in certain IRC channels, very slow terminal rendering to the point
that watching the output of compiling a large package will cause
Prompt to lag uncontrollably for tens of seconds, and a relatively
un-intuitive UI. Please note I am referring to Prompt, not Prompt 2[fn:1],
which is another problem in itself (the idea I need to pay for the
same product but rewritten to actually work is just ludicrous).

Another thing to note before I dig into Blink is I'm not a big fan of
mobile devices. They get the job done, but in most cases I rather
crack open my netbook and not fight with the learn-by-fiddling mobile
UI paradigms most devices have adopted. I am also not a fan of Apple's
ecosystem, but I'm pretty content with my iPhone and iPad for my
basic use cases: browse the web, chat applications, making phone
calls, casual mobile gaming, logging into other computers via SSH.

Enter Blink[fn:2]. This application does a few things differently from other
mobile SSH clients. It offers a command-line first user interface. At
first I thought this would be painful, but the application's verbs are
pretty simple and appear to match up with how one uses ssh and mosh in
a terminal emulator. The terminal emulator is responsive,
significantly more stable than Prompt, and looks good. I can even load
up my favorite font: Droid Sans Mono[fn:3] (thanks to its support for
loading webfonts via a URL to a CSS file).

Another thing Blink does different is it offers
Mosh support[fn:4]. Mosh is an alternative to SSH that can "roam" across
networks and device power state changes. One thing to note is Mosh
requires SSH to make the initial login, then switches to Mosh which
uses a different protocol. When using mosh, I tend to log in once
throughout the day. I can then switch networks and mosh will
gracefully reconnect as soon as the server is reachable again. In
addition, when I sleep my netbook, the session isn't lost (but don't
go using this instead of tmux or screen). Instead when I wake my
netbook, it also gracefully reconnects to the server. The same is true
of Blink's Mosh support. It even appears to save state between
changing iOS application states, sans forcing the application to quit
(or rebooting your device). This means I only log in once on my phone
throughout the day, and the connection is gracefully dropped when the
app becomes inactive and reconnects when the app is opened again.

I did notice I crashed Blink after writing non-ascii binary data to
the terminal followed by some other operations, but did not manage to
reproduce the crash yet. If I do, I am confident I can report the bug
and get meaningful feedback too, as Blink has a bug tracker on
GitHub[fn:8]. The code is available under GPLv3 (but not to worry, as the
single copyright holder can safely relicense it to deploy on the iOS
App Store[fn:6]). I could probably build it myself and install that, but I
neither own a Mac (or wish to install Mac OS X in a VM) nor want to
ever open XCode again even if I had a way to. That life isn't for me.
Again, I'm very practical about how I use my iOS devices and don't
enjoy using them more than I have to, so I'm willing to pay $20 for
an application I'll use every day of my life on this walled garden
platform. An added silver lining is this investment
goes towards the development of such a great app that appears to have
active maintainership.

Note: I did not explore some of Blink's features such as using it a
local iOS shell or settings synchronization. YMMV.

* Getting started

  Here are the steps I used to get started with Blink, as it was
  relatively unclear where to find documentation and which settings
  are necessary to configure. Usage information can be
  found via the =help= command, the README on GitHub[fn:7], and fiddling
  with the UI.

  1. Run the =config= command.
     1) Default User -> set to your preferred username on most of your servers
     2) Add a new font via: Appearance -> Add a new font. Open the
        gallery and grab the raw CSS file (you can get a raw URL after
        switching to GitHub desktop), then paste it into the URL
        Address Field. I prefer Droid Sans Mono for its readability at
        all sizes.
     3) Keys -> + -> Create New

        Please use ssh keypair authentication. Password authentication
        requires you to memorize a password to log in which can be
        bruteforced or otherwise leaked when typing it in the wrong
        context. Also, be sure to use a unique key on each of your
        devices to make revocation easier when a device is no longer
        used.

        Note: it appears keys are always stored as plaintext,
        which is acceptable for your uses, but it appears =ssh-keygen=
        can create a key with a passphrase. I wasn't able to get Blink
        to work with Passphrase protected keys, but I didn't try very
        hard. YMMV.

        - Type: RSA
        - Bits: 4096 (why not?)
        - Name: =id_rsa=
     4) Hosts -> +
        - Host: the name you gave your host when running =ssh host= or
          =mosh host=. This is not related to the server's hostname,
          though it can be the same. I prefer simple names, usually
          the hostname before the first dot (e.g. =worf.winny.tech=
          becomes simply =worf=)
        - User: make sure this is correct
        - Key: select a key to use.
  2. Now you need to install the SSH public key:
     1) Run =config= again
     2) Keys -> =id_rsa= -> Copy Public Key
     3) Install it some way.

        I usually prefer to visit
        https://ptpb.pw/f and paste the public key, hit Paste, then
        copy the url with the text of "created". You can then =curl
        https://ptpb.pw/PasteId= on the server via another login setup
        (or ssh from a set up machine) and add it to your
        =~/.ssh/authorized_keys=. Make sure that file is mode 0600
        (=chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys=). Also make sure the
        =.ssh= directory is 0700 (=chmod 0700 ~/.ssh=). OpenSSH
        refuses to use =authorized_keys= if these permissions are world
        readable.
  3. Run =ssh worf=. Congratuations, you now have a SSH session on the
     best iOS client available at this time.
  4. To use mosh, ensure mosh is installed on the server.[fn:5] Then
     run =mosh worf=.
