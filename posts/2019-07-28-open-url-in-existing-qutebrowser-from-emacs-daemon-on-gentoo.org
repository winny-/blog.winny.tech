#+title: Open URL in existing Qutebrowser from Emacs Daemon on Gentoo

On my Gentoo desktops, I use Emacs Daemon via =sys-emacs/emacs-daemon=[fn:1]
to ensure an Emacs instance is ready to go and always available from
boot. This is done via creating a symbolic link like
=/etc/init.d/emacs.winston= to =/etc/init.d/emacs= which will start Emacs
for the given user. See the package README for more details.

A shortcoming of this setup is =XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=[fn:2] is not set, as this is
set by my Desktop Session - maybe LightDM or consolekit set this? As a
result, when I open a URL from Emacs Daemon, it opens a fresh
qutebrowser session, loading the saved default session, and making a
mess of my workflow.

One approach to fix this might be to instead run Emacs daemon from my
=.xsession= script, but I rather not supervise daemons at the user
level; if I were to consider this, I'd be better off to switch to
systemd for user-level services anyway.

The solution I came up with is to add some lines to my =init.el= to
ensure =XDG_RUNTIME_DIR= is set to the expected value:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun winny/ensure-XDG_RUNTIME_DIR ()
  "Ensure XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is set. Used by qutebrowser and other utilities."
  (let ((rd (getenv "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR")))
    (when (or (not rd) (string-empty-p rd))
      (setenv "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" (format "/run/user/%d" (user-uid))))))

(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'winny/ensure-XDG_RUNTIME_DIR)
#+end_src

A strange emacs-ism: ~(user-uid)~ returns float or integer, despite the
backing ~uid_t~ (on *nix) is guarenteed to be an integer type. I'll just
assume this'll never return a float. Please contact me otherwise, I'd
love to hear about this.
