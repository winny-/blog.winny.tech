This most recent weekend (November 16th) I attended the [[https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/][Milwaukee Code
Camp]] and was pleased with the content. There was plenty of food,
coffee, and give-aways.

* The Talks

I attended five talks:

1. starting an open source project ([[https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/session/details/1217][link]]) [fn:2],
2. how to manage work life balance as a software developer ([[https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/session/details/1210][link]]),
3. getting started with [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/][Docker]] and [[https://kubernetes.io][Kubernetes]][fn:1] ([[https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/session/details/1212][link]]),
4. introduction to [[https://www.terraform.io/][Terraform]] for cloud infrastructure management ([[https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/Session/Details/1205][link]]),
5. and accessibility (a11y) on the modern web ([[https://www.milwaukeecodecamp.com/session/details/1234][link]]).

I am pleased to say the open source fellow recommended GPLv3, MIT/X,
and Apache 2.0 (and [[https://choosealicense.com/][choosealicense.com]]), so I have a lot of respect
for him. I think a lesser open source evangelist would recommend one
license, or strongly recommend one license. It really does depend on
your project.

I was able to get [[https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube][Minikube]] set up during the Docker/k8s talk in five
minutes. No surprises when installing it from the official Gentoo
repository. Just follow the installed readme, run the commandsâ€¦ it's
really quite easy to do. A friend commented it wasn't so simple on
their system to install Minikube and get it working.

While I don't think I would use Terraform at this point, I have a
good appreciation for when I might use it in the future. In
addition, I found a [[https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt][Terraform provider for libvirt]], so one could in
theory provision their own cloud infrastructure on a simple libvirt
cluster with Terraform. I believe this might be my first use-case
for Terraform.

It was refreshing to see people talking about accessibility and the
web. I am personally not a fan of the web stack for various
reasons.[fn:3] But the reality is the technology won't go away, and the
browser is the greatest common denominator both reaching users and
simplifying the a project's platform support matrix. It was great to
hear from somebody in industry "your website should be *somewhat*
usable without javascript". I am really pleased to hear this; perhaps
there is hope for the web ecosystem yet.

* The Food

  Sweet pastries, water, soda, coffee were available in the
  morning ad throughout the day. There may have been more
  comprehensive breakfast items (cereal?), though I was late for the
  first session. Lunch was Dominos pizza and brownies. There was no
  shortage of pizza. The coffee was catered from Panera Bread.

* Conclusion

  In addition to learning about Terraform, Kubernetes, and
  accessibility, I met a lot of cool people. I think this event was an
  overwhelming success. Thanks to everybody who organized this event.

* Footnotes

[fn:3] This is a discussion in itself. For example: I think a large
majority of the user and developer experience with web technologies
does not adhere to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment][principle of least surprise]], making it very
frustrating for everyone involved.
