#+title: Toggle Redshift with Keyboard Shortcut

Redshift is a screen-tinting program that achieves similar goals to
the popular f.lux[fn:2] program.

I perused through the redshift man-pages and noticed there is no
documented way to toggle redshift. Of course one can click the
notification area icon when using redshift-gtk or =SIGTERM= the
redshift process, but neither is very user friendly. (The mouse is not
user friendly.) After some awkward DuckDuckGo-ing and Googling I found
an obvious solution on the redshift homepage[fn:1]: simply send =SIGUSR1= to
the redshift or redshift-gtk process. When using redshift-gtk, one can
choose to send =SIGUSR1= to either redshift or redshift-gtk.

This is the script I came up with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu
if ! pkill -x -SIGUSR1 redshift; then
    echo 'Could not find redshift process to toggle.' >&2
    exit 1
fi
#+END_SRC

After installing the script into my system's =PATH=, now all I have to
do is add a line to my Xbindkeys[fn:3] configuration file (=~/.xbindkeysrc.scm=) such as:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(xbindkey '(Mod4 F2) "toggle-redshift")
#+END_SRC

Now I can type =Mod4-F2= and toggle Redshift.
