<p>
Awhile back I noticed my personal <code>mnt/</code> directory, my (empty) personal
<code>tmp/</code> directory, and a few symbolic links disappeared from my home
directory. I only noticed because I use unison<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> to synchronize my
desktop and laptop homedirs. The actual amount of removed directories
and symbolic links were staggering, and it costed me five minutes of
extra effort to search through the unison UI to ignore files I don&rsquo;t
want to synchronize. Repeat this a few times a day, with the problem
occurring at seemingly random intervals, and you&rsquo;ve wasted minutes out
of every day, which adds up to hours every month.
</p>

<p>
For months I had not figured out what the problem was. By chance I had
noticed while using my application launcher, I had accidentally not
ran <code>links -g</code> <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> but instead had ran <code>cleanlinks</code>. I wonder to myself
what was I running by accident, as I had done this before, but had not
thought anything of it, assuming it was a program that would print
usage or perform a no-operation by default.
</p>

<p>
I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
Turns out <code>cleanlinks</code> searches the current working directory for <b>empty</b>
directories and <b>broken</b> symbolic links. Both are useful. For example I
keep empty directories in <code>~/mnt/</code> to mount <code>sshfs</code> stuff, and I prefer to
use <code>~/tmp/</code> as a work directory because no system scripts will touch
it.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> I had a few <b>broken</b> symbolic links scattered about, from
weird git repositories working trees to some stale user-level systemd
unit links from my archlinux install.
</p>

<p>
Making things more interesting, if you run <code>cleanlinks --help</code>, or with
any flags, it operates as usual. So it&rsquo;s a mistake to also do
<code>cleanlinks /some/directory/i/want/to/clean</code>. As a part of imake,<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
the old X11 ecosystem build tools, <code>cleanlinks</code> will be installed on
many systems and it&rsquo;s not safe to run it lest you enjoy random stuff
being messed about with in your current directory.
</p>

<p>
How did I manage to run <code>cleanlinks</code> so many times? I did not have links
installed on the affected machine. And even after I did install it, I
forgot to remove <code>cleanlinks</code> from my rofi runcache. So it had a higher
precedence to match than <code>links</code> in certain cases. Hence I ran it a few
times on accident even after installing links.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, I strongly recommend one doesn&rsquo;t fuzzy match over their
<code>PATH</code>. Who knows what other nasty tools ship on your system that will
lay waste your productivity, or worse, damage your personal files.
</p>

<p>
Regardless, I have yet to heed my own warning. Maybe I should just use
<code>.desktop</code> files, but then again, maybe there exists a
<code>cleanlinks.desktop</code>&#x2026; Ideally, I&rsquo;ll create a directory of  symlinks to
programs I want to launch from rofi. Someday :)

I should mention unison is a superb tool for synchronizing your
data. It shows the user a list of changes to each directory being
synchronized, waits for the user to decide which way each file should
be synchronized:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Send file from host A to B</li>
<li>Send file from host B to A</li>
<li>Ignore the file this time</li>
<li>Ignore the file permanently</li>
<li>Merge the files</li>
</ol>

<p>
Because unison doesn&rsquo;t try to be fancy or automatic, it is easy to
understand what is happening.
