<p>
About a fortnight ago (Nov 9th) I went to the MSOE x Google Cloud
hackathon.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> There was pizza, soda, and Google Cloud gear. Each group
was given a <a href="https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/vision">Google AIY Computer Vision kit</a> to assemble, and build a
proof of concept around.
</p>

<p>
The kit contained a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400">Raspberry Pi Zero W</a>, the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3099">Raspberry Pi Camera
Add-on</a>, a breakout board to provide simplified pin-outs for a button
with an integrated light, an additional LED that mounted next to the
camera to indicate if the camera was active, and a piezo buzzer.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> All
these components fit into a carefully engineered cardboard box that
folded onto itself, held together with adhesive tape. The assembled
device was remarkably robust and easy to operate.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org15ca80f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org15ca80f">Challenges</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org15ca80f">
<p>
We were among the first group to finish building the kit. It turned
out the software on the included SD card was not exactly what we
needed, and the SD card writing software for Windows (<a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a>) was a
bit unreliable and did not clearly indicate to the user of a
successful write. After a second attempt we had bootable SD card.
</p>

<p>
The system took a couple minutes to boot and resize itself. Mind
you, we did not have a Mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, nor a monitor to
output the Raspberry Pi display. Thus we had to wait, chat, and eat
pizza.
</p>

<p>
The next challenge was to &ldquo;pair&rdquo; the device with a wifi network so
one could SSH into it. There is an android app for this, and at
first we paired it with a spare android device acting as a
hotspot. Unfortunately this configuration did not give us internet
access when connected to this wireless access point. We were able to
verify the device was working, SSH in, and inspect the images we
took via the kit&rsquo;s included camera.
</p>

<p>
We moved to a more central location, as the most cognitively
demanding part was complete &#x2014; construction of the device, and
ensuring it works. This lead to more networking challenge. We wanted
a way to network this device to the internet so we could not only
log into it via SSH, but access PyPi from the device, and access
StackOverflow from our laptops on the same network. With a little
brainstroming we came up with this network topology:
</p>


<figure>

</figure>

<p>
Yes, as you can see the path from the internet is (A) public wifi
(B) my friend Karl&rsquo;s android phone (C) his laptop via bluetooth
tethering (D) finally a wifi network via his laptop&rsquo;s built in
wifi. We had an intemittent hiccup with nameserver configuration not
set up correctly on the host wifi network — as such any DNS would
not resolve. A quick tweak to Karl&rsquo;s network manager settings
mitigated this. And like that… we were networked together on a
private wifi network complete with internet access.
</p>

<p>
There were some other techincal issues. Because of our network
topology, the round trip time to the internet was very high,
occasionally over a second from the pi, and pip has a relatively low
timeout when installing stuff. The workaround was to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43298872/">tell pip to
calm down, and be patient</a>. I had installed tmux so we could share a
session across the table (for pair programming), and the apt man-db
triggers <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1064366/436920">took around 5-15 minutes</a>; with the crunch time we had, this
felt unacceptable. The other technical issue we had was the fact the
raspbian image starts up a lot of unnecessary services by default
which eat into the rasperry pi zero w&rsquo;s very limited memory. This
caused pip to crash due to failure to allocate memory. We had to
disable lightdm (GUI) and the default vision kit demo. Had this been
a device I&rsquo;d use for more than a couple hours, I&rsquo;d go through and
disable things like GIO services, and other bloat that we never
would use.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile our other two group members worked on a proof of concept
game. The idea the device comes up with a common word, and the user
carries the device around, showing it various text on the wall or on
paper. Using a cloud <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a> service, it can recognize the
words seen by the camera. It then will buzz happily when it is shown
the correct word, or buzz sadly if shown the wrong word. Then the
process repeats. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;iSpy&rdquo; with computer vision and words — a
word hunt!
</p>

<h2 id="orgb1af17d">Completion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb1af17d">
<p>
While our PoC was not deployed in time for presentations, we were
about five to ten minutes away from setting it up, and demoing
it. During the presentations, we found that many of the other groups
experienced the same issues with the Google AIY Vision Kit — due to
the Raspberry Pi platform, Raspbian, and the way one pairs it to
wifi. At least one other group managed to get some non-default code
running on their Pi. We were only given around 3-4 hours from start
to finish, with a time loss factor due to slow internet speeds to
download the initial SD card image, man-db triggers rendering the
device unusable for awhile, and dealing with the lack of suitable
networking configuration.
</p>

<p>
Given all these challenges, I think we did very well. As did every
other group that participated. We did have competition for 1st
place, because some of the other groups had PoC&rsquo;s (though some did
not get the Pi completely working) and others did get the Pi working
but did not have a PoC. We were selected as 1st place, and each was
given either a <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini">Google Home Mini</a> or a Google Cloud hoodie. I went
with the hoodie because I don&rsquo;t want to use Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7072285?hl=en">creepy</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAP4N3KyLmM">spyware</a>
voice assistant. And the modding/reverse engineering community has
done very little with this product; nobody has loaded custom
firmware on it, for example.

<h2 id="org1ba0a7b">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1ba0a7b">
<p>
Our issue in seeking out a usable networking topology had be thinking:
if I simply had a device with two wifi radios, I could run one as an
Acesss Point and the other connected to Public WiFi. This device would
then yield this topology, which would be ideal for these sorts of
impromptu projects and activities:
</p>

<p>
In addition, it would be perfect for demonstrations of man in the
middle attacks on public wifi, or experimenting with multipath tcp and
wifi.
</p>

<p>
With these sorts of events that start early on a Saturday morning,
it&rsquo;s been useful to agree with a friend to attend the same event. That
way both parties are more likely to show up, because it wouldn&rsquo;t be
very personable to cancel last minute. We also had a wonderful team. I
later met up with most of the same team for another event (post
incoming). Hackathons are a great way to meet new people. I enjoyed
this event thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
See you at the next hackathon :)
